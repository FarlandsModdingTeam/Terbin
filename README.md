# Terbin

Command-line tool to help create and manage Farlands mods.

## Requirements

- .NET 9 SDK
- Windows x64 (the provided `build.bat` publishes for `win-x64`)

## Build and run

- Build a self-contained binary:
  ```powershell
  .\build.bat
  ```
- Run the CLI (after build):
  ```powershell
  .\Terbin\bin\Release\net9.0\win-x64\publish\terbin.exe <command> [args]
  ```

Tip: Add the `publish` folder to PATH to invoke `terbin` from anywhere.

## Quick start

Set up a new mod end-to-end with one command:

```powershell
terbin setup -y
```

This will:
1) Ask (or auto-accept with `-y`) for Farlands install path, store it in `.terbin`.
2) Create `manifest.json` (auto-confirmed with `-y`).
3) Generate the project `<Name>.csproj` and run `dotnet restore`.
4) Copy Farlands Managed DLLs into local `libs` (excludes `System.*` and `mscorlib.*`).
5) Generate `plugin.cs` from the manifest.

Alternatively, run step-by-step:

```powershell
terbin config fpath <path>   # or: terbin config fpath (interactive prompt)
terbin manifest [-y]         # creates manifest.json via dialog
terbin gen                   # generates <Name>.csproj and restores packages
terbin inf                   # copies game DLLs into ./libs (excludes System.* and mscorlib.*)
terbin bman                  # generates plugin.cs from manifest
terbin build                 # runs bman then dotnet build on <Name>.csproj
```

## Files created/modified by Terbin

- User configuration (global):
  - Path: `%USERPROFILE%\.terbin`
  - Purpose: stores local settings used by commands.
  - Fields (typical):
    - `FarlandsPath`: full path to your Farlands installation.
    - `Instances`: map of instance name → path.
    - `index`: cached mods index (list of references) used by `mods list`.

- Project files (per project, current working directory):
  - `manifest.json`: created by `terbin manifest`; contains Name, GUID, Versions, url, Dependencies.
  - `<Name>.csproj`: created by `terbin gen` based on the manifest Name.
  - `plugin.cs`: generated by `terbin bman` (also by `terbin build`).
  - `libs/`: created by `terbin inf`; copies DLLs from `Farlands_Data/Managed` (excludes System.*, mscorlib.*, netstandard.*).

- PowerShell profile (optional, only when installing completion):
  - `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
  - `terbin completion --install` appends a small section to enable tab-completion.

## Commands

- `info`
  - Shows Terbin and current project info (manifest path, existence, etc.).

- `help` [command]
  - Shows general usage and the list of available commands, or details for a specific command.

- `manifest` [`-y` | `--yes`]
  - Checks for `manifest.json`; if not present, offers to create it.
  - With `-y/--yes`, it auto-confirms and skips yes/no prompts.

- `gen`
  - Generates `<Name>.csproj` targeting `net35` with basic dependencies.
  - Runs `dotnet restore` for the generated project.

- `config`
  - Configures local Terbin options (saved in `.terbin`).
  - Subcommand: `fpath <path>` sets the Farlands install directory.
    - If `<path>` is omitted, Terbin will prompt: “Enter Farlands path:”.

- `inf`
  - Copies DLLs from `<FarlandsPath>\Farlands_Data\Managed` into `./libs`.
  - Skips assemblies starting with `System.` and `mscorlib.`.

- `bman`
  - Generates `plugin.cs` from the current `manifest.json`.
  - Plugin template uses BepInEx and logs a startup message.

- `build`
  - Generates `plugin.cs` (same as `bman`) and then runs `dotnet build` on `<Name>.csproj`.
  - Errors if the project file does not exist (run `gen` first).

- `setup` [`-y` | `--yes`]
  - Runs the main steps in order: `config fpath` → `manifest` → `gen` → `inf` → `bman`.
  - Propagates `-y/--yes` so confirmations are auto-accepted.
  - Reloads `.terbin` and `manifest.json` after each relevant step so later steps see fresh values.

- `instances`
  - Manage game instances (cloned game folders configured in `.terbin`).
  - Subcommands:
    - `create <name> <path>`: clones the Farlands installation into `<path>`, optionally installs BepInEx; adds the instance to config.
    - `list`: shows configured instances (name → path).
    - `run <name> [exe]`: launches the instance. Defaults to `Farlands.exe` under the instance path if `[exe]` not provided.
    - `open <name> [subpath]`: opens the instance folder in Explorer; selects a file if `[subpath]` points to one.
    - `delete <name> [-y]`: removes the instance entry from config (does not delete files). Prompts unless `-y/--yes` is specified.
    - `add <name> <mod>`: downloads and installs a mod (from the mods index manifest) into the instance’s `BepInEx` folder.

- `mods`
  - Manage the mods index (list of available mods and their manifest URLs).
  - Subcommands:
    - `list`: shows the cached index if available; if no cache, downloads it. Hints to run `mods update` to refresh.
    - `update`: forces a re-download of the index and saves it into `.terbin`.

- `version`
  - Manage the version string in `manifest.json` (uses the last entry in `Versions`).
  - Subcommands:
    - `show`: prints the current version.
    - `list`: prints all versions.
    - `upgrade [major|minor|patch|<newVersion>]`: bumps or sets a new version and appends it to `Versions`.
    - `downgrade`: removes the last version entry.


## Logging

All commands/dialogs use a common logger:
- Sections with headers for readability.
- Colored levels: info, success, warning, error.
- Consistent prompts: `Ask` (input) and `Confirm` (yes/no).

## Configuration file

Terbin stores local settings in a JSON file named `.terbin` in the user profile (`%USERPROFILE%`).

Example structure:
```json
{
  "FarlandsPath": "C:\\Games\\Farlands",
  "Instances": {
    "MyInstance": "D:\\Farlands\\Instances\\MyInstance"
  },
  "index": {
    "references": [
      { "name": "ExampleMod", "guid": "com.example.mod", "url": "https://.../manifest.json" }
    ]
  }
}
```
The file is written automatically when you set `FarlandsPath`.

## Manifest

The mod manifest (`manifest.json`) contains:

```json
{
  "Name": "...",
  "GUID": "...",
  "Versions": ["1.0.0"],
  "url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
  "Dependencies": ["fm.fcm"]
}
```

It is created via the interactive dialog (`terbin manifest`) and used by `gen`, `bman`, and `build`.

## Troubleshooting

- Unknown command
  - Run `terbin info` to see available commands.

- `manifest.json` missing
  - Run `terbin manifest -y` to create it quickly.

- Farlands path not set
  - Run `terbin config fpath <path>` or `terbin config fpath` and follow the prompt.

- Project already exists
  - `gen` will warn if `<Name>.csproj` already exists; delete it or adjust the manifest name.

- Build fails
  - Ensure you ran `gen` and that `<Name>.csproj` exists.
  - Check errors printed by `dotnet build` for missing dependencies or code issues.
